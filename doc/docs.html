	<h2 id="h2_2">2.2 Configurations</h2>
	<p>Game configurations are stored in "game.ini" and can be edited in the "Host" menu or when hosting a room on a server.</p>
	<h3>Victory Points</h3>
	<p>Use the victory points game variant. The input field determines how many points each player needs to collect to win. If the checkbox is set, middle row fortresses will be placed in the center. If it isn't checked, middle row fortresses will be placed in the remaining free spaces.</p>
	<h3>Ports</h3>
	<p>Use the ports game variant.</p>
	<h3>Row balancing</h3>
	<p>Use the row balancing game variant.</p>
	<h3>Homefront</h3>
	<p>Use the homefront game variant.</p>
	<h3>Set piece battle</h3>
	<p>Use the set piece Battle game variant. The input field determines how many pieces each player can use.</p>
	<h3>Homeland size</h3>
	<table class="listing">
		<tr>
			<td>width</td>
			<td>Is equal to the number of tile columns of the board. The minimum is 5 and the maximum is 101.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>height</td>
			<td>Is the number of tile rows of each player's homeland, which is "board_height / 2 - 1". The minimum is 2 because a fortress can't be placed in the bottom row and the maximum is 50, amounting to a maximum board height of 101.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<h3>Battle win chance</h3>
	<p>Probability of winning a battle.</p>
	<h3>Fate's favor maximum</h3>
	<p>Can be set to a value in the range of 0 to 16383. Its effect is described by "Fate's favor total".</p>
	<h3>Fate's favor total</h3>
	<p>If enabled, "Favor maximum" will be the limit of how many times each player can use each type of fate's favor in one match. If disabled, "Favor maximum" will be the limit of how many of each type of fate's favor each player can stock up.</p>
	<h3>First turn engage</h3>
	<p>Controls whether players can attack or fire during their first turn.</p>
	<h3>Terrain rules</h3>
	<p>Controls whether to use terrain related rules. This setting doesn't affect the breaching of tiles or rules inherent to the pieces' movement range.</p>
	<h3>Dragon place late</h3>
	<p>If enabled, dragons don't have to be placed during setup and can be placed later on homeland fortresses during the match.</p>
	<h3>Dragon move straight</h3>
	<p>If enabled, a dragon can only move in a straight line. Otherwise one move's steps will be treated separately and the dragon will use the shortest path to a destination.</p>
	<h3>Capturers</h3>
	<p>A list of pieces which will be able to capture a fortress. If the list is empty, it'll be filled with all piece types.</p>
	<h3>Homeland tiles</h3>
	<p>A list of the amounts of each player's homeland tiles. The minimum amount for each tile type other than a fortress is the homeland height and the maximum of each is the number of remaining free tiles. Sliders' ranges are set accordingly. The amount of fortresses is set to the amount of the remaining free tiles on a homeland. The number of fortresses is limited to "homeland_height * 2 + board_width - 2" and when exceeded, other tile amounts will be increased with the priority being the order of the listed tile types.</p>
	<h3>Fortresses captured</h3>
	<p>The number of enemy fortresses that need to be captured in order to win. This value is limited to the number of homeland fortresses.</p>
	<h3>Middle tiles</h3>
	<p>A list of the amounts of middle row tiles per player. The total amount is limited to the range of 0 to "board_width / 2" floored. The amount of fortresses is set to the amount of the remaining free tiles, that is "board_width - total_amount_of_tiles_per_player * 2". The sliders work like the homeland tile amount sliders.</p>
	<h3>Pieces</h3>
	<p>A list of the amounts of each piece type per player. The total amount of pieces is limited to the range of 1 to the homeland tile count. If there's 0 pieces, the amount of thrones will be set to 1. The sliders work like the tile amount sliders.</p>
	<h3>Thrones killed</h3>
	<p>The number of enemy thrones that need to be killed in order to win. This number is limited to the number of a player's thrones. If both winning conditions are set to 0, this one will be set to 1. If the amount of thrones is set to 0, it'll be incremented and if the piece limit has been reached, one other piece amount will be decremented in turn, the priority being the reverse order of the listed piece types.</p>

	<h2 id="h2_3">2.3 Setups</h2>
	<p>
		Game setups are stored in "setup.ini" and can be edited, saved and loaded in the "Host -&gt; Setup" menu or during the in-game setup phase. The offline editor works the same as setting up a game online, except any checks for proper tile and piece placement will be ignored.<br>
		When loading a setup, it only overwrites the current tiles/pieces of each stage when the loaded setup's corresponding stages' tile/piece data is present.<br>
		The same setup can be loaded for different configurations, but some tiles and pieces may not get placed due to exceeding limits.
	</p>

	<h1 id="h3_0">3 Networking</h1>

	<h2 id="h3_1">3.1 Client</h2>
	<p>
		A game client can be used as a server by going into the "Host" menu, optionally setting an appropriate port and the configuration that'll be used for the game rules, and clicking "Open". Once another client successfully connects to the server, a game will start immediately.<br>
		A client can set an address and port of a server and connect by clicking the "Connect" button in the main menu. When connecting to a regular server program, a list of open rooms will be displayed. A room can be joined by left clicking its name or a new one can be created by clicking "Host". Only a room's host can edit the configuration and start the game.<br>
	</p>

	<h2 id="h3_2">3.2 Server</h2>
	<p>
		The server program can be used to host multiple players. The maximum number of rooms is the limit of players halved and rounded up.<br>
		If the program has been compiled without the "SERVICE" define, the following keys can be used when running it in the foreground:
	</p>
	<table class="listing">

			<td>P</td>
			<td>list players</td>
		</tr>

	</table>

	<h1 id="h4_0">4 Game</h1>
	<p>Every game starts with the setup stage where players place their tiles and pieces. Once both players confirm their setups, the actual match starts.</p>

	<h2 id="h4_1">4.1 Setup</h2>
	<p>
		The setup stage is a sequence of three phases of placing homeland tiles, middle row tiles and pieces.<br>
		Tiles/pieces can be placed by selecting an icon in the bottom panel and left click holding on a free tile and optionally dragging the cursor across other occupied tiles to replace them. A type can be selected by pressing the icon, using the mouse wheel or pressing a number key.<br>
		It's possible to drag a tile/piece with the left mouse button and place it somewhere else or switch places with another. Tiles/pieces can be removed by using the "Delete" button or right click holding on them and optionally dragging the cursor across other ones.<br>
		Fortress tiles will be placed automatically, where no tiles were placed.<br>
		After the setup the middle row tiles will be rearranged if necessary and the match starts.
