	<h3 class="intro">Based on the board game by Chad Anthony Randell:</h3>
	<p class="intro">
		"Thrones is a game designed to cultivate cunning and strategic maneuvering on a battlefield created by you, your opponent, and the battle between you.<br>
		The struggle for supremacy will take many forms as your infantry melee, cavalry charge, and artillery fire.<br>
		You may strike with your Throne’s royal guard or unleash a Dragon on any challenger to your claim. Not even fate itself is out of your influence and reach.<br>
		Your enemies, however, are diverse, and their lands will be treacherous to a conqueror. Destruction of their armies is just one path to victory;<br>
		If you succeed in claiming their Fortress as your own, a pretender’s family will surely plea for peace, which you can consider as their army disbands in defeat."

	<h1>Actions</h1>
	<p>Must choose one:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Move one piece, then may move a separate piece.</li>
		<li>Switch two allied, adjacent pieces and may move a piece.</li>
		<li>(Attack) Move onto an adjacent tile to remove it’s piece.</li>
		<li>(Fire) Remove one piece on another tile without moving.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Each piece can move one tile, one direction by default. Pieces can move over allied pieces if able. Ranged pieces cannot attack tiles, only fire on them.</p>

	<h1>Terrain</h1>
	<p>Each tile affects how a piece interacts with the battlefield and its opponents..</p>
	<io>
		<li>Pieces cannot attack from Mountains. </li>
		<li>Mountains cannot be fired over.</li>
		<li>Mountains and Forests cannot be fired onto.</li>
		<li>Cavalry pieces must be on Forests to attack Forests.</li>
		<li>Forests cannot be attacked by Dragons.</li>
		<li>Pieces cannot fire from Forests or Water.</li>
		<li>Water cannot be attacked.</li>
	</io>

	<h1>Fortresses</h1>
	<p>A piece occupying a Fortress tile has high walls and battlements keeping it safe. The piece cannot be engaged (attacked or fired on) until the Fortress is breached.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A successful attack or firing (determined by a Battle) breaches the Fortress tile.</li>
		<li>A breached Fortress is flipped upside-down, and it’s piece can now be engaged next turn.</li>
		<li>The Fortress does not restore (unbreach) itself until it is unoccupied at a turn’s end.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Warhorses can only switch positions with an enemy piece occupying a Fortress if it is breached.
		Dragons must be able to occupy the tile outside the Fortress from the direction it would attack.<br>
	</p>

	<h1>Battle</h1>
	<p>Pieces engage in battle for Fortresses, and the fog of war makes its outcome fearfully unclear. The attacker flips a coin, rolls a die, or uses the #2 method from “Gameplay” to discover if it wins or loses.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Win the Battle with an even number: the attack/firing succeeds.</li>
		<li>Lose the Battle with an odd number: the piece cannot fire this turn.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If the battle is lost during an attack, your opponent may move that piece to any adjacent tile. In either loss, the player can attack, fire, or move and/or switch other pieces to finish the turn, or attack the Fortress again, if there is a piece capable of it.</p>

	<h1>Fate’s Favor</h1>
	<p>
		When the Throne occupies a Fortress different from the one it did previously (or starts the game in its homeland Fortress), it gains a special, single-use Fate’s Favor tile. Their effects are listed below.<br>
		A player can use Fate’s Favor effects in addition to a Move and/or Switch Action only.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Hasten: </b>Adds one tile of movement to any allied piece that player controls.</li>
		<li><b>Assault: </b>One additional move and/or switch of different, allied piece(s). </li>
		<li><b>Conspire: </b>A chosen, announced piece cannot engage or be engaged next turn.</li>
		<li><b>Deceive: </b>Switch any two adjacent enemy pieces.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There is a max of one of each FF tiles per player. Any number of FF tiles can be played in one turn. A player needs to reveal what FF tile they have only when they use that particular effect. Don’t let your opponent see it!</p>

	<h1>Game Setup</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Each player gets 13 Pieces, 14 Plains, 9 Forest, 7 Water, 5 Mountain, and 1 Fortress.</li>
		<li>Players choose even or odd, and hold numbers on their hands behind their backs and reveal them simultaneously; the sum of the numbers decides who goes first. A sum of 10 requires a redo. Battles can also be resolved this way.</li>
		<li>Set the rule board as a screen so players cannot see their opponent's homeland; players place their tiles and pieces. Homeland Fortresses cannot border game board boundaries.</li>
		<li>Each player is given 4 tiles (one of each type) and puts them between their front tile row and the screen, intended as where they want them placed in the middle row.</li>
		<li>Remove screen. If both players have set middle row tiles for the same contested place, first place all uncontested tiles down in the middle row; then move both contested tiles to the leftmost open space of the player that is moving first, starting from their left.</li>
		<li>The middle row Fortress occupies wherever no tile was set, after all 8 tiles are set.</li>
		<li>The game starts! Each player cannot attack/fire on their first turn. Winning requires the removal of your opponent's Throne or occupying your opponent's homeland Fortress with your Throne.</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>Variants</h1>

	<h2>Ports</h2>
	<p>Any Water tiles set on the game board's borders are considered Port tiles in this gametype; a Port allows a unit occupying it to occupy/attack any other Port tile.</p>

	<h2>Row Balancing</h2>
	<p>Lay pieces and home tiles with at least one of each of the 4 tile types in each of the 4 rows.</p>

	<h2>Set Piece Battle</h2>
	<p>During setup (when players set their tiles and pieces) they must choose 10 of the 13 pieces. The 3 they do not choose are left out of the battle. Must include Throne as 1 of 10.</p>
